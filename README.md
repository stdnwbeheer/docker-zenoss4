# docker-zenoss4
This project is a fork of this project: https://github.com/krull/docker-zenoss4

## description
The Zenoss4 Stack is seperated into its own dockerized images. All docker images are pushed to our own repositories for testing purposes.

* [memcached](https://cloud.docker.com/repository/docker/stdnwbeheer/memcached/), a distributed memory caching system, named `zenoss4-memcached`
* [rabbitmq](https://cloud.docker.com/repository/docker/stdnwbeheer/rabbitmq/), the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), named `zenoss4-rabbitmq`
* [redis](https://cloud.docker.com/repository/docker/stdnwbeheer/redis/), a networked, in-memory, key-value data store, named `zenoss4-redis`
* [mariadb](https://cloud.docker.com/repository/docker/stdnwbeheer/mariadb/), SQL Database backwards compatible to `mysql 5.5`, named `zenoss4-mariadb`

The dockerized image of zenoss v4.2.5 is aptly named `zenoss4-core`.

The main glue for all of this orchestration is really the [docker-compose.yml file](https://github.com/stdnwbeheer/docker-zenoss4/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) which pulls everything together. You can read more information on `docker-$

The [Dockerfile](https://github.com/krull/docker-zenoss4/blob/master/Dockerfile) for the `zenoss4-core` build has directives that points to the necessary hostnames of each dockerized services mentioned above to function properly and col$

Many thanks for [hydruid](https://github.com/hydruid/zenoss/) for providing us a way to install zenoss4 on debian-based systems! Thanks for all the fish, Hydruid!

I have tried to build the image with docker best practices in mind. Should there be anything of note you notice, please do not hesitate to leave a comment.

Once the init is done, you ought to have a full, 100% working `zenoss4` docker install located at `http://localhost:8080`! Default zenoss login: `admin`/`zenoss`
